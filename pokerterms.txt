	What is an 'out': an out is a card that "completes" your hand, for example, you get
	a straight on the turn or a flush on the turn or a full house on the river or even a
	high-card pair on the turn/river.
	
	For example: if our hand is 5C 6S and the flop is 7D 8C AD, then we have 8 possible
	outs: all four 4s and all four 9s, any one of which make a straight. A straight is
	the highest possible winning hand we can go for on this table with our hand.
	
	If our hand is AH and KH and the flop is 5H JC 7H, then we only need one heart to get
	a flush. Here, we have 9 possible outs: all the hearts other than A, K, 5, and 7.
	
	If our hand is AC and KC and the flop is 9 2 6 rainbow, then we know that not a lot of
	players have struck gold on the flop because most players fold low cards like 6s and 9s.
	So, technically, even if someone has a pocket pair, or a pair on the flop, we have 6 outs
	3 aces and 3 kings.
	
	Outs to percentage using the 2x4 rule:
	//////////////////////////////////////
	If you want an out, and have till the river to get one (the first two examples), you
	multiply the number of outs by 4 to get the %. However, if you have more than 8 outs, 
	you subtract the difference of (number of outs - 8) from the original percentage
	obtained by (number of outs * 4).
	If we NEED an out by the turn, (3 same suits, 2 in hand, 1 on table, for example), we
	multiply by 2 instead of 4.
	So, for the first example, the out % is 8 * 4 = 32%
	For the second example, the out % is 9 * 4 - (9 - 8) = 35%
	For the third example, the out % is 6 * 4 = 24%
	
	
	EXPECTED VALUE:
	///////////////
	Expected Value is basically a mathematical term for: In the long run, this play is
	expected to net me X amount of money.
	+EV: a play is expected to be profitable in the long run.
	-EV: a play is expected to lose money in the long run.
					   ------------------------------
					   | EV = (%W * $W) - (%L * $L) |
					   ------------------------------
	where %W is the percentage of times our hand will win,
	$W is the amount of money we earn if our hand wins,
	%L is the percentage of times our hand will lose, and
	$L is the money we will lose if our hand loses.
	For example, if we play a coin game where we earn $3 every time it lands heads,
	and we lose $1 every time it lands tails, our EV is (0.5 * 3) - (0.5 * 1) = 1
	Since our EV is 1, +ve, we earn profits in the long run. That is, if we play a
	a million times, we should earn in the ballpark of a million dollars.
	In Poker, we use "Equity" for determining our winning (and thus, losing) percents.
	
	Hand Equity (or pot equity): the percentage probability of winning the pot at any
									given point of the han
